## Homework

These programmes have been created during the course "Computational Intelligence" (TUM) as part of the programming homework projects.

For each assignment, a single source file had to be uploaded which explains the rather unusual length of these .c files. 

The assignments have covered the following topics (among others)
- Clustering (k-means++, g-means)
- Hoppfield-Networks
- Self-Organizing Maps
- Simple Fully-Connected Neural Networks
- Reinforcement-Learning Agents in a simple Grid World
- Trajectory-following controller using fuzzy control
